# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

This crate is intended for Zenoh's internal use.
It is not guaranteed that the API will remain unchanged in any version, including patch updates.
It is highly recommended to depend solely on the zenoh and zenoh-ext crates and to utilize their public APIs.

The purpose of this crate is to optionally pin dependencies necessary to build zenoh with Rust 1.75.
