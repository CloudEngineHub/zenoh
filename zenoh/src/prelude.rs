//! A "prelude" for crates using the `zenoh` crate.
//!
//! This prelude is similar to the standard library's prelude in that you'll
//! almost always want to import its entire contents, but unlike the standard
//! library's prelude you'll have to do so manually.
//!
//! There are three variants of the prelude: full, sync and async. The sync one excludes the [`AsyncResolve`](crate::core::AsyncResolve) trait and the async one excludes the [`SyncResolve`](crate::core::SyncResolve) trait.
//! When specific sync or async prelude is included, the `res()` function of buildes works synchronously or asynchronously, respectively.
//!
//! If root prelude is included, the `res_sync()` or `res_async()` function of builders should be called explicitly.
//!
//! Examples:
//!
//! ```
//!use zenoh::prelude::*;
//! ```
//! ```
//!use zenoh::prelude::sync::*;
//! ```
//! ```
//!use zenoh::prelude::r#async::*;
//! ```
